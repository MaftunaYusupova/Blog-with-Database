Blog Website with database

I have done this website before but it had a problem, when we openthe page again all the posts that we composed will be deleted. And now using database we solved that problem, 
the website will automatically save what the user will compose and you will be able to see the posts whenever you enter the website.
And it is done by using  Node.js,EJS,  JSON, jQuery, Mongoose to help us create our database, CRUD operations and various packages like express, body-parser, lodash and others
